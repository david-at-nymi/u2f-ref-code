A number of U2F BLE conformance tests:

	- BLE Transport tests
	- U2F Raw Message tests.
	- Limited ADPU encoding tests


To build these tests you will need:

	git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/lollipop-release/

Supported platforms (tested):
	Windows 8 + Windows Platform SDK 8 + VS2012
	Windows 10 + Windows Platofrm SDK 10 + VS2015


Building for Windows:
	nmake -f Makefile.win


IMPORTANT:
	Windows 8.0 does NOT support resolvable private addresses. 
		Higher version have not been tested.
	Windows 8.0 does NOT support PIN based pairing. Windows 8.1 and
		above do.


Usage

By default the test will select the first U2F device reported by Windows.
You can list the available devices as follows:

	BLETest -l

Which will return the device Identifiers of the available FIDO BLE devices.
You can then run the test on a specific device by doing:

	BLETest -d "<device identifier>"

Full usage:

Usage: BLETest [-d <device-identifier>] [-l] [-h] [-a] [-v] [-V] [-p] [-e] [-u] [-t] [-w] [-i] [-c] [-x]
  -h : this text.
  -a : Do not abort on failed test.
  -v : Verbose
  -V : Even more verbose
  -p : Pause at failed test
  -e : Device does preapproval when turned on
  -u : Disable U2F Raw Message tests.
  -t : Disable BLE Transport tests.
  -i : Enable U2F ISO7816-4 encoding tests.
  -w : Warnings are treated as errors.
  -x : Disable encrypted connection requirement.
  -c : Toggle ANSI colors.
  -l : Show all known FIDO BLE devices and exit.
  -d : Select specific FIDO BLE device.



Compatible hardware:

All testing has been performed with a CSR8510 A10 based dongle.
