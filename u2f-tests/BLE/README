A number of U2F BLE conformance tests:

	- BLE Transport tests
	- U2F Raw Message tests.
	- Limited ADPU encoding tests


To build these tests you will need:

	git clone -b lollipop-release https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/

	If you have git support included in VS2015, this will be done automatically.

Supported platforms (tested):
	Windows 10 + Windows Platofrm SDK 10 + VS2015

Verified hardware:
	Thankpad Bluetooth 4.0 (BCM20702A1)

Building for Windows:
	nmake -f Makefile.win


IMPORTANT:
	Windows 8.x does NOT support resolvable private addresses. 
		Windows 10 does support RPA.
	Windows 8.0 does NOT support PIN based pairing. Windows 8.1 and
		above do.


Usage

By default the test will select the first U2F device reported by Windows.
You can list the available devices as follows:

	BLETest -l

Which will return the device Identifiers of the available FIDO BLE devices.
You can then run the test on a specific device by doing:

	BLETest -d "<device identifier>"
